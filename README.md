# Profesional-readme



AS A developer
I WANT a README generator
SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project

GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository
THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions
WHEN I enter my project title
THEN this is displayed as the title of the README
WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions
THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests
WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options
THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
WHEN I enter my GitHub username
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
WHEN I enter my email address
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions
WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents
THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README

## Description 
My professional Readme was crated because as a small start up company of coders we have a constant flow of new employees and creating this Professional readMe will establish a standard company wide in regards to our Standard Operating Procedures. As new employees start their journey With this company and collaborating with other developers is is a key aspect to have a "change Log" thats readable and proffesional. The Problem this prevents is a wide range of different readme's coming across the board. everyone follows a standard making it easier to collaborate and and reach the goal.

here is a link to a video showing how it works: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xm1pe5e4PzP-QS4Ihg3QUVPtxwKofQ1s/view
